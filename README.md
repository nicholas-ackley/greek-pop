# 👕 GreekPop – College & Greek Life Resale Marketplace

**GreekPop** is a specialized marketplace app for reselling college apparel and Greek Life merchandise. GreekPop is designed specifically for students and campus communities, offering exclusive features that blend resale with social, cultural, and event-based context.

## 🧠 Why GreekPop?

General resale platforms don’t capture the exlusive, or value context of Greek Life or college events. GreekPop introduces innovative, community-first features that make it more than just a resale platform — it’s a college culture hub.
